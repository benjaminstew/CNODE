My implementation of:
- the direct collocation-based Neural ODE training algorithm outlined in the 2025 paper ["Training Neural ODEs Using Fully Discretized Simultaneous Optimization"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15642) (Mariia Shapovalova, Calvin Tsay). 
- an updated version of the algorithm using the integrated residual regularised direct collocation (IRR-DC) formulation outlined in the 2025 paper ["Reliable Solution to Dynamic Optimization
Problems using Integrated Residual Regularized
Direct Collocation"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09123) (Yuanbo Nie, Eric C. Kerrigan).
 
The methods are tested on a synthetic Van der Pol oscillator dataset.

Results for each method can be viewed in VDP_results.ipynb
